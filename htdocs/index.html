      This will actually be the interesting part, because I will have to make a file
      that can view different types of content. Maybe just differentiate between two things,
      such as lists (for videos/users) and single (view a single user/video).

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Crowder</strong> is a community based video streaming platform. Every user
        that views videos is not just downloading the parts he needs to view the video, but
        is also uploading those parts that he already downloaded to other users needing them.
        The technology behind it is based on the bittorrent technology and is in fact
        compatible with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This setup allows for a very robust network, because videos that are currently interesting
        and get watched a lot, are also being shared alot. On top of that, popular videos are
        also loading faster, because there is a higher chance that someone near you is sharing his
        parts of the videos directly with you, which is a lot faster than connecting to one
        central distant server.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Legal questions</h2>
      <p>
        Bittorrent is often falsely associated with illegal sharing of copyrighted material.
        It is important to note though, that the protocol itself is completely legal and is not
        posing any threat to you as a user. On this website, we are making sure that there is no
        copyrighted material is uploaded without the consent of the copyright-holder. <br />
        What this means for you as a user is, that you will not find many music-videos or TV-shows
        here, since they all fall into the copyrighted category. We are also against geoblocking
        and as such are not hosting videos that have licenses that would restrict playback to
        certain countries.
      </p>

<!--
    I think the footer will always be the same, so I can make that one static. But I will probably
    still externalize it, just to make it simpler to change it later on. This file really should
    just be a skeleton. Also this does not need the padding of the content, that's why it is outside
    of it.
